        "Tax assessors at local government agencies often rely on surveys to estimate property valueand calculate property taxes. These surveys are infrequent, which means that there can besome inaccuracy in the assessment records. Swimming pools are an important part of theseassessments because they impact the value of the property. You will use ArcGIS deep learningtools to detect all swimming pools in a defined area. Tax assessors can use this information toidentify newly constructed pools that were not recorded in the assessment records. Thisinformation will help tax assessors identify more appropriate property values ​​and taxes, whichcan lead to additional revenue for the community.\n",
